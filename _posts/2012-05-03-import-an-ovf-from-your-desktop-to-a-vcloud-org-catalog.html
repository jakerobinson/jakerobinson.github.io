Have you downloaded a really cool appliance in OVF and want to quickly upload it to your vCloud Director Org? The Web UI would be one way to do it, but I sometimes run into issues with the java uploader.

Here's a simple PowerCLI method to get your OVF appliance from your desktop into your Org:

[sourcecode language="powershell"]

$ovfPath = &quot;C:\users\me\desktop\MyCoolAppliance.ovf&quot;

$orgVdc = Get-OrgVdc &quot;My Org vDC&quot;

$catalog = Get-Catalog &quot;My Catalog&quot;

Import-CIVAppTemplate -SourcePath $ovfPath -OrgVdc $orgVdc -Catalog $catalog

[/sourcecode]

As a subjective observation, it seems to run a lot faster than the Java uploader, but pending a real speed test, it's just another way to upload an OVF into your catalog. :D
