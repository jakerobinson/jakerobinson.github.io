While the functionality is not in the API, PowerCLI and Powershell make short work of it with the vCloud snap-in and Powershell's Send-MailMessage cmdlet.

The task in this case was to send an email to all Org users to remind them of the number of VMs they have in a particular organization. The following code could easily be adapted to show: Resource usage, IP addresses, OS usage, etc.

Probably the most interesting thing I find about this code is that it can be used in either a systems admin role, or an organization admin role.

[sourcecode language="powershell"]

$mailServer = &quot;mail.example.com&quot;
$users = Get-CIUser # use -Org &quot;OrgName&quot; if connected to system Org
$VApps = Get-CIVApp # use -Org &quot;OrgName&quot; if connected to system Org

foreach ($user in $users)
{
 $counter = 0
 $ownerVApps = $VApps | where {$_.owner -eq $user}
 $vapps | ForEach-Object {$counter += $_.extensiondata.children.vm.count}

$mailbody = &quot;Greetings, You currently have $counter virtual machines in Organization: $($user.Org)&quot;

Send-MailMessage -SmtpServer $mailServer -To $user.email -From &quot;PowerCLI@example.com&quot; -Body $mailbody

}

[/sourcecode]
