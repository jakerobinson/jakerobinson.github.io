<p>I was asked recently to write a script to get a count of virtual machines with Flexible adapters that did not have VMware tools installed. While having a Flexible type network adapter is fine and not having VMware tools installed is sorta fine, but together they force your NICs to 10Mb. TEN MEGABIT, PEOPLE! It's like we're back in 1999!</p><p>It's been a while since I brushed up on my VMNIC</p>
