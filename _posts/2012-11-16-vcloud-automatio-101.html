Agility. You need it, cloud has it. The idea that infrastructure is there when we need it is alone a killer benefit, but there's more... We see people talking about amazing features like auto-scaling, continuous integration, and auto-deployment that are revolutionizing the way IT and software development work. It seems Utopian and so far away that we don't know where to start.

Let me help you start your journey.

The vCloud API plays a key role in building custom experiences in the cloud. Knowing the vCloud API is a feeling of freedom, and opens up endless possibilities. You want to know how AWS got to where they are? APIs. Twitter? APIs.

So how do we get started with the vCloud API? I have a great beginner lesson on the API my TrainSignal course: <a href="http://www.trainsignal.com/VMware-vCloud-Director-Organizations-Training.aspx" target="_blank">VMware vCloud Director Organizations</a>. It covers what the vCloud API is, and demonstrates how to make raw RESTful API calls. That being said, we want to start automating quickly and easily.

There are a number of SDKs and toolkits that have vCloud API support. Here's a list of the ones I know, and if you know of any more, please leave me a comment and I'll add it to the list.

No matter what language you prefer, the easiest way to get started automating in vCloud is with PowerCLI. VMware PowerCLI is a snap-in for Powershell, Microsoft's automation framework. Powershell's scripting language turns commands (called cmdlets) into simple a simple verb-noun format. For instance, If you want to get a list of your Virtual Machines running in your vCloud Organization, you simply type <strong>Get-CIVM</strong>. (CI stands for Cloud Infrastructure and is used to differentiate between getting VMs in other VMware products.)

Enough introduction! Lets get started by downloading <a href="http://vmware.com/downloads/download.do?downloadGroup=PCLI51R1T" target="_blank">PowerCLI for vCloud Tenants</a>. There is another PowerCLI snap-in that has vSphere and provider level cmdlets that are not needed unless you use vSphere or are a vCloud provider.
