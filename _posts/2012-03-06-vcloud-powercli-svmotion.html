What's the correct capitalization supposed to be? sVmotion? SVMotion? SvMotion? Blah, whatever. The point is, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/lamw" target="_blank">William Lam</a> wrote a couple <a href="http://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2012/02/performing-storage-vmotion-in-vcloud.html" target="_blank">killer</a> <a href="http://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2012/02/performing-storage-vmotion-in-vcloud_19.html" target="_blank">posts</a> on doing a storage vMotion through the vCloud API. Feeling the PowerCLI mafia needed a solution as well, I went ahead and wrote it. William's post about performing the vMotion with the REST API made writing the PowerCLI code very easy.

A few general things to note:
<ol>
	<li>This is a storage vMotion for the entire VM. If you have VMs with multiple disks on different datastores, the theoretical behavior is that it will move all disks to the same datastore.</li>
	<li>You have to be a user with SYSTEM access. Normal Org admins don't have to worry about such things as datastores. It's all abstracted. :D</li>
	<li>You can't SvMotion to vCloud-disabled datastores. (I could think of some interesting use cases for that, but it doesn't work. ;))</li>
	<li>This is a great method to empty datastores for doing fresh VMFS volumes. Jason Boche has a great VMFS 5 <a href="http://www.boche.net/blog/index.php/2011/07/21/vmfs-5-vmfs-3-whats-the-deal/" target="_blank">article here</a>. Don't forget to disable the datastore in vCloud Director before running! :D</li>
</ol>

<strong>Lines 4-11:</strong> This is basically some validation to make sure we are not trying to migrate to the same datastore.
<strong>Line 14:</strong> Get information on the datastore we are migrating to.
<strong>Line 15:</strong> Create a reference object.
<strong>Line 16:</strong> Search-Cloud only returns an ID, so we have to construct the href ourselves. (Has to do with the query type Seach-Cloud is using. No biggie.)
<strong>Line 17:</strong> Relocate!
