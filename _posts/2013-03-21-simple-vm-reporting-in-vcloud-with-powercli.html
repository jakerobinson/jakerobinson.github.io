Because of the unique requirement of VMs to exist inside vApps in vCloud Director, it's a challenge to get a nice view of all the VMs and their locations within your vCloud Organization. This can mostly be satisfied with a <span style="color:#3366ff;">Get-CIVM</span> command, which will return great info about your VMs, but it's missing the storage assignment. Here's a sweet little script to report specifically on the VM resources in use inside your vCloud Organization:

{% gist 22711bb993a23aaff863 %}
<div style="text-align:Left;font-family:Segoe UI;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:12px;color:#000000;">
<p style="font-family:Lucida Console;margin:0;background-color:#ffffff;"></p>

</div>
You can easily export to a CSV by using <span style="color:#3366ff;">Export-CSV</span>Â or just run the report to get output that looks something like this:
