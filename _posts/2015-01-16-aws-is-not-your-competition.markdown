I was working at Bluelock when EC2 first landed as an AWS service. I remember looking at all of its limitations and thinking "We've got nothing to worry about! Great for developers, not for production. Enterprises will never use it. Our focus is on the *real*, long-running production workloads, not these ephemeral short lived workloads. NO SLA!? They have to be joking."

* No high availability
* No persistent block storage
* No size flexibility
* No SLA
* Proprietary machine images
* Running on Xen, not VMware

I was 'right' for a very brief amount of time. I am not afraid to admit I became wrong very quickly. 


It seemed like every week new features were being added. The EC2 users (developers) started hacking around the limitations and creating new and innovative libraries and automation tools to use the cheap compute
