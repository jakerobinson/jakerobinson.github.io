Dear <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jsnover" target="_blank">Santa Snover</a>,

I met you briefly following a PowerCLI session at VMworld and gave you a part of my wishlist, but didn't want to take up your time at that point. Here is my FULL Christmas wishlist!
<blockquote>
<ol>
	<li>JSON support, like XML support. To Quote Jeff: "Watch this space."</li>
	<li>A fix for the XML &lt;item&gt; bug! <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/PowerShell/SearchResults.aspx?SearchQuery=xml%2bitem" target="_blank">HERE!</a></li>
	<li>ISE in a web browser. Heck, I would even take just the console. Something like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/shellinabox/" target="_blank">THIS</a>. This would kinda give cross-platform support for those who use OSX or Linux.</li>
	<li>Intellisense in ISE for cmdlets and .NET namespaces. I love ISE because it is so lightweight. All the other IDEs I have tried are too slow. All I want to do is code.</li>
	<li>REST API support. This one is kinda iffy, as I can easily use [System.Net.Webclient], but built in XML/JSON validation would be sweet, or maybe even build a PSobject from an XML/JSON namespace.</li>
	<li>Multi-threading support that doesn't require me to load 3rd party snapins for each job. Or, more specifically, doesn't hog memory like it's going out of style.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<div>That's it. Just six requests. I can't guarantee whether I am on your naughty or nice list (I did mention Linux...), but these sure would be swell additions.</div>
<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;
<div>A cool Powershell polo would be nice too.</div>
<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;
<div>Cheers,</div>
