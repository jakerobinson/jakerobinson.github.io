You've stumbled upon my "about" page. I can assume one of two things about you. You're either stalking me, which is completely flattering, but also creepy...or you are here to learn something. Maybe the term "Geek after Five" intrigues you. Maybe you want to know where I work, or what I look like, or how I made that cool "Link" graphic from Zelda. I intend to answer all of that on this page. Of course, if you want to know something else, I'd love to chat! Hit me up on twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jakerobinson" target="_blank">@jakerobinson</a>.
<h2>Jake Robinson in a Nutshell</h2>
I could do a really funny Austin Powers impression about being in a nutshell, but I will spare you. That does bring up a pretty good point though. I'm goofy, I love to laugh and am always optimistic.
<h3>My Profession</h3>
I'll spare you the long drawn out version of my professional story, but I'll tell you I knew I wanted to be in the technology field since I was in 6th grade. I consider myself an IT Generalist, but specialize in Virtualized Infrastructure. I now work at Bluelock, an amazing  Public Cloud Provider that was founded in 2006. We've been VMware based since day 1, and the Bluelock/VMware partnership has only gotten stronger. My official title is Systems Engineer, but my responsibilities vary and include Sales Engineer, Solutions Engineer, and public speaker. The best part of my job is Infrastructure Automation. There is no greater thrill to me than writing code that saves someone hours of time. Powershell is my weapon of choice, but I can write code in a variety of languages.

Leslie and I have been married over 8 years. My son Lucas takes after his dad in the goofy department. He loves to laugh too. Leslie knew she was marrying a geek, so she's learned quite a bit of the technobabble that I constantly output. You'll see Leslie with me at big conferences, so feel free to come hang with us!
<h3>My Faith</h3>
I have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. All the glory belongs to Him. Ask me about it!
<h2>"Geek After Five"</h2>
<a href="http://geekafterfive.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/gaficon.png"><img class="alignright  wp-image-368" title="gaficon" alt="" src="http://geekafterfive.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/gaficon.png" width="154" height="154" /></a>Are you passionate about something? For me, it's technology. I can't get enough of it. I find joy in reading API programming specifications, and then writing code. I love taking stuff apart to see how it works, and then figuring out how to make it better. I love making things from scratch to understand the process. Understanding things is very important to me. I have to <em>know</em>. The term "Geek after Five" was coined by Pat O'Day, Bluelock's CTO. Sitting across from him in a Mexican Restaurant, he said to me "We look for the 'Geek after Five' factor in our Engineers." I knew exactly what he meant. It was the passion for learning, specifically in the field of IT. He knew I had it. It was easy to spot. You can tell in the inflection of a person's voice what they are truly passionate about.  "Geek after Five" simply means that you are not bound by the 8-5 work schedule. You are driven to learn...to <em>know</em>...to satisfy a thirst for knowledge.

Find what you are truly passionate about and be a "Geek after Five".
<h2>The Logo</h2>
8-bit art is cool. Zelda is cool. Link is certainly the best character in video game history. His 8-bit representation makes for a fun personal brand that captures my persona. I grew up with the Zelda franchise, so I have a certain attachment to it. I did the logo by hand, pixel by pixel in GIMP on a 100x100 canvas.
